\autoref{fig:txAge9715} show the age profiles of cost-contribution for 1997 and 2015 as examples. Compatible with the life cycle theories of consumption, cost-contributions are positive at younger and older ages but negative during prime age as production surpasses consumption.

To account for the difference in age structure by immigration status, we standardize the age profiles with the age structure of the 2011 population census. Results are quite differentes from previous ones.

For instance, the difference in Net Transfer between native on one hand and  immigrant group on the other hand has increased to ()



This leads to an increase in net contributions of 660\$ for a native and net costs of about 2930\$ for an immigrant
