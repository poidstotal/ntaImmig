\subsection{Source of income gap}

Income gap between immigrants and natives arises as result of a number of factors that includes the decision to participate, hiring discrimination and wage discrimination.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
Decision to participate in the labor market is partially tied to individual or household characteristics.
Immigrants settling in a new country take some time and there are some personal or household of characteristics that make them unable to participate in the labor market in earlier years of their arrival.
For example, woman with young children would prefer taking care of the baby as they come from a culture where babysitting or professional childcare is not well ingrained.
Some immigrants, both men and women would prefer going back to school just after their arrival or after facing difficulties in the labor market.
As a result of these individual behaviors, labor market participation rates among immigrants that landed 5 years or less is only 70.7\% in 2019 against 76.2 for immigrant that landed 5 to 10 years earlier \citep{statCan:002}.
However theses differences fade away usually in about 5 years after arrival, as they become more integrated in the society.
When immigrants overcome these personal limitations and decide to participate in the labor market, finding and keeping a job would also require facing ans overcoming the hiring discriminations.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
Hiring discriminations consist of barriers that make it difficult for immigrants to find and retain adequate jobs.
For example, immigrants hardly make it to the interview stage, as recruiters dismiss their application if their name is not English sounding.
The common justification for such decision is that an applicant with non English name is very unlikely to satisfy the language requirement of the position.
There may be some situation where this assumption holds.
But in most cases, such assumption represent an implicit discrimination, perhaps unintentional \citep{Crandall:wo,ROOTH2010523}, where employers justify name discrimination based on language skill concerns, but incorrectly overemphasize these concerns by disregarding all other offsetting characteristics listed in the resume \citep{Oreopoulos:2011jv}.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
Hiring discriminations are directly result in a higher level of unemployment among recent immigrants compared to established immigrants and natives \citep{Oreopoulos:2011jv}.
For instance, in 2019 the unemployment rate among immigrants that landed 5 years or less was 9.9\% compared to 6.5\% for those landed more than 5 to 10 years earlier and 5.5\% for natives \citep{statCan:002}.
Indirectly, hiring discriminations have two consequences.
First, Immigrants are forced to take temporal or seasonal position leading to unmet desired number of hours.
Second, they immigrants are pushed toward jobs for which they are massively overqualified.
The first situation lead to visible under-employment while the second is characterized as invisible under-employment \citep{ilo:1982icls}.
Under-employment not only represents a significant wastage of labor supply \citep{Mitchell:2008wo} but also, according to many \citep{CanadianLabourCongress:2014wi,Li:2006uu}, ``Canada's real labor market challenge''.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
Measuring visible under-employment, \citet{gilbert:2020b} estimate that between 2013 and 2017, the odd of being under-employed for recent immigrants compared to natives, is about 40\% among women (20\% for men).
Even 10 years or more years after arrival, the average immigrant still has 15\% more unmet desire of hours compared to natives.
\citet{Li:2006uu} also found that immigrants are among the most susceptible of over-qualification, as 52\% (compared to only 28\% among their Canadian-born counterparts) of recent immigrants with a university degree worked in a job requiring only high school education at some point between 1993 and 2001.
Consequently, low-income rates (that is the percentage of person living under the poverty line) have risen continuously for each successive cohort of immigrants over between 1980 and 2000  \citep{picot2003rise}.
For example, Immigrants men working in under-employment situations earned 42\% less per week in 2000 compared to their counterparts employed full time in jobs requiring a university degree.
The gap was 39\% for women and 47\% for young men \citep{Morissette:wh}.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
If under-employment is an important medium to low income among immigrants, it however accounts for a relatively small part of the earning gap between immigrants and Canadian born.
For instance, \citet{Morissette:wh} found that after controlling for highest education and job requirement degrees, immigrants working full-time still earned about 20\% lower their counterparts natives in 2000 and the gap remains even beyond 10 years after arrival.
This suggest that, even with same education and job position, differences between immigrants and natives persist as a result of wage discrimination.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
Wage discrimination arises when immigrants are paid less than natives for the same type and amount of work.
One reason for such discrimination is that employers attach a lower value to educations and work experiences from some country relatively to other.
\citet{Coulombe:2014ir} found that although recent immigrants have, by design, more years of schooling and work experiences, lower quality of human capital completely negates this advantage, and is by far the major source of wage gap between immigrants and natives.
Using GDP per-capita in an immigrant's country of birth as a proxy for the quality of schooling and work experience acquired in that country, the authors demonstrate that controlling for human capital quality reduced the wage gap by almost 62\% for male immigrants and virtually eliminated it for female immigrants.
In a slightly different setting, \citet{Fortin:2016hl} found that the location of education alone account for up to 70\% of the wage difference with largest (negative) premiums on educational degrees obtained in Asian countries.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
More recently,  \citet{Block:2019va} point out that employment and earning inequality are but the tip of the iceberg of an unequivocal racialized economic discrimination in Canada.
For instance, non-racialized immigrants do better in the Canadian labour market, and do better sooner, than racialized immigrants do.
Moreover, income inequality between racialized and non-racialized Canadians extends to second and third generations-and beyond \citep{Block:2019va}.
Therefore, the idea that earning gap between immigrants and natives reduces over time to eventually disappear is apparently not applicable in the Canadian context, as most immigrants in Canada never reach wage parity with natives.
This is because assimilation is neither immediate nor automatic \citep{Hum:2000gz} or uniform across regions \citep{Nadeau:2010jd}.


\subsection{Limitations and future research}

This study contributes new results to the immigration debates using relatively new datasets and advanced methods.
However, there is room for improvement in various including, the effects of a changing demographic structure, an extended scope of the immigrant population, the age at arrival and the healthy immigrants effect.
As we have seen, omitting the demographic difference between immigrants and natives results in enormous bias in analysing the difference in transfer between the two populations.
Although, we have accounted for this difference for each year, the effect of changing population structure from one year to another, also need to be accounted for accurate trend comparison.
The bias may be small for consecutive years but important over the years as the population ages and immigration continue.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
Demographic effect may also arise from a different composition of the immigrants population.
For instance, although this study has gathered data over many years, the transversal nature of these data make it applicable only to the first generation of immigrants.
As pointed out by previous studies \citep{Lee:1998fs}, defining the immigrants population is particularly challenging, and enlarging the immigrants population by including more generations of immigrants may lead to difference results.
First generation refers to people who were born outside Canada but now living in the country as citizen or permanent resident.
Those born in Canada but have at least one parent born outside the country belong to the second generation while those with both parents and themselves born in Canada belong to third generation.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
Even for first generation immigrants, the age at arrival could be a source of difference in transfers.
For instance, there is a general assumption that immigrants arriving at working age represent a saving in childhood and education expenses which largely occur in the country of origin.
For example, \citet{Dustmann:2014dr} found that between 1995 and 2011 European and non-European immigrants endowed the UK labor market with human capital that would have cost \pounds14 and \pounds35 billion respectively if it were produced through the British education system.
Unfortunately, the age of arrival has not been accounted for in this study due data limitations.
But, results from this study suggest that, immigration has made a similar contribution in Canada, as they represent about 24.2\% of the Canadian population but are responsible for only 14.5\% of education costs in 2015.


\vspace{0.7em}\par
If arriving later implies saving in education costs for the host country, departing earlier is also expected to reduce age related expenses such as health care, since some immigrants return to their home country to spend the last part of their life that is most cost-intensive \citep{Bratsberg:2014cl}.
However, opposite results have been observed in Canada.
For instance, the 24.2\% immigrants are responsible for 29.5\% of health expenses in 2015.
These results also contradict expectations that immigrants are healthier than natives.
The so called Healthy Immigrant Effect (HIE) refers to the fact that recent migrants are in better health than the native population \citep{Ichou:2019ik,Vang:2016di}.
This foreign-born health advantage is largely the result of health being one of the most rated criteria for immigration and applicant whose health condition may cause an excessive demand on health or social services are more likely to be refused.

\subsection{Conclusion}

Overall, the average immigrant contributed for about \DTLfetch{statex}{sKey}{AveImmigrantsOutflows}{sVal}\$ per year while receiving about \DTLfetch{statex}{sKey}{AveImmigrantsInflows}{sVal}\$ per year in average between 1997 and 2017.
A native on the other has contributed \DTLfetch{statex}{sKey}{AveNativesOutflows}{sVal}\$ but received \DTLfetch{statex}{sKey}{AveNativesInflows}{sVal}\$.
In net, immigrants received about of \DTLfetch{statex}{sKey}{AveperCapita}{sVal}\$ more than native on average between 1997 and 2015 and this surplus is increased to \DTLfetch{statex}{sKey}{AveAdj.Transfer}{sVal}\$ when comparing immigrants and natives at the same age.
Labor market imbalances are the main the source of this difference accounting for  \DTLfetch{statex}{sKey}{SIprop}{sVal}\% of the net surplus.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
Theses results lie somewhere between that of \citet{Grubel:2012wo} and \citet{Javdani:2013gu} who reported \$6,051 and \$500 respectively for the fiscal year 2005/2006.
Although this alone would make our results much acceptable, their reliability lie more in the NTA method which is more englobing than previous methods in regard with transfers included and the scope of the immigrant population.
If results from this study clearly show that immigrants are a cost to public finances, they also provide evidence that this situation is a consequence of important discrimination in the labor market.
Therefore, rather than debating on whether or not immigrants intake should be increased or reduced, it would be much beneficial to debate on how to enable immigrants to achieve their full potential on the labor market.
This may involve adjusting the selection criteria, but most importantly addressing the labor market imbalances.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
In our opinion, cultural, racial or any form of discrimination does not persist unless there is some economic and social value associated to it.
Throughout history, discrimination has allowed to construct social classes for the purpose of transferring wealth from lower classes to the upper classes.
These classes have taken many names - proletariat and bourgeoisie, working class and nobility, the 99 and one percent, etc.- but the social gradient has remained the same because its economic purpose has persisted.
While this research and the extensions suggested would provide more insights on the fiscal effect of immigration, more fundamental investigation into the nature and causes of socioeconomic inequality is required to reduce these differences.
Canada and the world will need agile thoughts leaders and decision makers who can assess the building block of our society and engage the changes required for its improvement.
