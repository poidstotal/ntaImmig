In Canada, immigration constitutes the primary response to population ageing. While extensive research has covered the impact of immigration on various aspects of the labour supply, the financial aspect has received less attention.
In this study, we apply the National Transfer Account (NTA) method and demographic decomposition to estimate the net fiscal cost of immigration in Canada between 1997 and 2015.
Results show that, on average, immigrants received about \$\numUp{AveperCapita} more in Net transfer per capita than natives between 1997 and 2015.
However, this cost is mainly the result of labour market imbalances which, after removing the effect of demographic differences, account for \numUp{SIprop}\% of the surplus.
