In Canada, immigration constitutes the main response to population aging.
The impact of immigration on various aspects of the labor market has been extensively researched, but its fiscal impact has received less attention.
In this study, we apply the National Transfer Account (NTA) method and demographic decomposition to estimate the net fiscal cost of immigration in Canada between 1997 and 2015.

Results show that on a per capita basis between 1997 and 2015, immigrants received about of \DTLfetch{statex}{sKey}{AveperCapita}{sVal}\$ more than natives in public transfers.
Furthermore, accounting for the difference in age structure between the two populations not only increases the net surplus of immigrants to \DTLfetch{statex}{sKey}{AveAdj.Transfer}{sVal}\$ but also reveals the labor market imbalances as the source of \DTLfetch{statex}{sKey}{SIprop}{sVal}\% of the surplus.
