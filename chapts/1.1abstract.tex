In Canada, immigration constitutes the primary response to population ageing. While extensive research has covered the impact of immigration on various aspects of the labour supply, the financial aspect has received less attention.
In this study, we apply the National Transfer Account (NTA) method and demographic decomposition to estimate the net fiscal cost of immigration in Canada between 1997 and 2015.

Results show that immigrants received about of \$\DTLfetch{statex}{sKey}{AveperCapita}{sVal} more in Net transfer per capita than natives between 1997 and 2015.
Moreover, accounting for the difference in age structure between the two populations not only increases the Net Surplus of immigrants to \$\DTLfetch{statex}{sKey}{AveAdj.Transfer}{sVal} but also reveals the labour market imbalances as the source of \DTLfetch{statex}{sKey}{SIprop}{sVal}\% of the surplus.
