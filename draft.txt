It may be useful to remind here that while the fiscal components vary accross accounts and ages \( F= \displaystyle\sum_{c}\displaystyle\sum_{a} = F_{ac}\), demographic components on the other hand, vary accross ages but remain constant accross accounts (\( D= \displaystyle\sum_{a}  S^{r}_{a}=S^{r}_{ac} \)).



that contrary to demographic components which are constants across transfer accounts (\( S^{r}_{a}=S^{r}_{ac} \)), the fiscal components, \( D_{ac} \) on the other hand, vary along with the \(T_{ac}\).


\subsection{Source of income gap}
The income gap between immigrants and natives arises from several factors in the labour market, including the decision to participate, hiring discrimination, and wage discrimination.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
The decision to participate in the labour market partially relates to the individual or household characteristics.
For example, women would prefer taking care of their young child, perhaps for financial or cultural\footnote{coming from culture where babysitting or professional childcare is not well ingrained} reasons, instead of using professional babysitting or public childcare service.
Some immigrants, both men and women, are constrained to going back to school just after their arrival or after facing difficulties in the labour market.
As a result, immigrants aged 25-54 and who landed five or fewer years earlier are significantly less active in the labour market than their counterpart natives, with only 77.4\% against 88.8\% for counterpart natives in 2019 (Statistics Canada: Table 14-10-0083-01).
After deciding to participate in the labour market, immigrants may also have to overcome hiring discrimination when finding and keeping a job.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
Hiring discriminations consist of barriers that make it difficult for immigrants to find and retain adequate jobs.
For example, immigrants have more difficulties making it to the interview stage, as recruiters dismiss their application if their name is foreign-sounding \citep{Crandall:wo,ROOTH2010523,Oreopoulos:2011jv}.
Directly, hiring discriminations result in a higher level of unemployment among recent immigrants compared to established immigrants and natives \citep{Oreopoulos:2011jv}.
For instance, in 2019, the unemployment rate among immigrants that landed five years or less was 9.9\% compared to 6.5\% for those who landed more than 5 to 10 years earlier and 5.5\% for natives \citep{statCan:002}.
Indirectly, hiring discriminations have two consequences.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
First, they constrain immigrants to take temporary or seasonal positions and thus to work fewer hours than desired.
This situation is referred to as underemployment \citep{ilo:2013icls,gilbert:2022b,Mitchell:2008wo,CanadianLabourCongress:2014wi}.
\citet{gilbert:2022b} estimate that between 2013 and 2017, the odds of being underemployed for recent immigrants compared to natives is about 40\% higher among women and 20\% for men.
Even ten years after arrival, the average immigrant still has 15\% more unmet desire of hours than natives.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
Second, hiring discriminations push immigrants toward jobs for which they are massively overqualified.
\citet{Li:2006uu} found that immigrants are among the most susceptible to being over-qualified, as 52\% (compared to only 28\% among their Canadian-born counterparts) of recent immigrants with a university degree have worked in a job requiring only high school education at some point between 1993 and 2001.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
Underemployment and overqualification have resulted in the rise of low-income rates, which is the percentage of persons living under the poverty line, for each successive cohort of immigrants between 1980 and 2000  \citep{picot2003rise}
For example, among immigrants with a university degree and working full-time, over-qualified men earned 42\% per week in 2000 less than their counterparts employed in jobs requiring a university degree.
The gap was 39\% for women and 47\% for young men \citep{Morissette:wh}.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
If hiring discriminations contribute to low income among immigrants, it accounts for a relatively small part of the earning gap between immigrants and Canadian-born.
For instance, \citet{Morissette:wh} found that after controlling for the highest education and job required degrees, immigrants working full-time still earned about 20\% less than natives in 2000, and the gap persists even beyond ten years after arrival.
This result suggests that the persisting difference between immigrants and natives is due, at least in part, to wage discrimination, even for the same education and job position.

\vspace{0.7em}\par
Wage discrimination arises when immigrants receive lower payments than natives for the same type and amount of work.
One reason for such discrimination is that employers attach a lower value to education and work experiences from some countries than others\citep{Coulombe:2014ir,Fortin:2016hl}.
Employment and earning discriminations go, however, beyond educational considerations.
\citet{Block:2019va} see these as the tip of the iceberg of unequivocal racialized economic discrimination in Canada.
As a result, non-racialized immigrants do better in the Canadian labour market and sooner than racialized immigrants.
Moreover, income inequality between racialized and non-racialized Canadians extends to second generations and beyond \citep{Block:2019va,Nadeau:2010jd,Hum:2000gz}


\vspace{0.7em}\par
While this research and the extensions suggested would provide insights into the fiscal effect of immigration, a more fundamental investigation into the nature and causes of socioeconomic inequality is required to reduce these differences.
Canada and the world will need agile thoughts leaders and decision-makers who can assess the building block of our society and engage the changes required for its improvement.
In that direction, a starting but critical point in Canada would be to investigate and address the sudden degradation in the Immigrant Surplus from 2011.
